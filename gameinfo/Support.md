## Platform Support

**Current Version:** 1.3.0.3

### Windows
- **Windows 11:** Fully Supported.
- **Windows 10:** Supported. (64-bit versions)
- **Older Windows versions(8.1, 7, etc.)**: Sorry, but since Python 3.11+ are officially unsupported, the game will probably run into errors.
#### Note for Windows Users: Since this app is from an "Unverified Publisher," Windows SmartScreen may block the initial launch. Click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway" to start the game.

### Linux
- **Ubuntu/Debian-based:** Supported (tested on Linux Mint, Ubuntu and Debian).
- **Arch Linux:** Confirmed Working. (Tested on KDE Plasma). The standalone binary runs smoothly without needing manual library installation.
- **Other Distros:** Untested. Since this is a pre-compiled binary, it may run into library version conflicts on non-Debian systems.
