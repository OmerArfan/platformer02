1)If you run Python directly without an editor like VSCode, it might default to your System32 folder and not find the game files. This can cause errors. Thatâ€™s why using VSCode is the safest option!
  Download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

2)Install(Safest choice):
  Python 3.11+
  Download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  Pygame 2.6.1
  YOU CAN INSTALL IT USING pip install pygame IN CMD(Windows)
  BeautifulSoup4 & HTML2text
  INSTALL USING pip install beautifulsoup4 html2text in CMD(you can also add pygame here, so you install all 3 at once!)

3)If you haven't already, download the ZIP file, what are you waiting for lol...

4)Open the ZIP folder and extract the main file folder 

5)Move the game folder to a safe and accessible location (like your Documents or where VSCode normally opens projects from).

5)Open VScode, click "file" in the top left corner.

6)Click "Open Folder".

7)Navigate to the main game file, select it and click "open".

8)Then run the "platformer.py" file in VScode by clicking the "play"-like button on the top right.

9)If you cannot see the play button, then you need to select the interpreter from the bottom right(choose the python version in where all the other imports are installed!)

9)Cry.
