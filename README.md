## About the game!
Roboquix is a simple game where you move Lil Robo by using the arrowkeys or WASD keys, towards the end portal. But in the process, you have to dodge obstacles, collect coins to open locked blocks, adjust to challenging mechanics, amd more!
If you complete the level quickly, you will be rewarded a medal accordingly, and these will help you get a higher score, as long as you also try not to die while dodging obstacles.
