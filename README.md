## About the game!
Roboquix is a simple game where you move Lil Robo towards the purple end portal. You have to dodge obstacles, jump through gaps, collect coins to open locked blocks, and run away from chasing saws. If you complete the level quickly, you will be rewarded a medal accordingly, and these will help you get a higher score, as long as you also try not to die while dodging obstacles.

## Found any bugs?
Please don't hesitate to report them in the [Issues](https://github.com/OmerArfan/platformer02/issues) section of this repository, but do provide the following details:
  - Which OS and on which version (e.g. Windows 11 Build 26100, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) are you running the game on?
  - What is the model of your device, and what CPU and GPU does it have?
  - Where is the glitch happening and what did you expect to happen instead? (so that I can clarify if there might be any misunderstanding)
  - It would be appreciated if you showed a photo of the glitch, if it is possible for you to do so.
