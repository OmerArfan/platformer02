Roboquix is a simple game where you move Lil Robo towards the purple end portal. You have to dodge obstacles, jump through gaps, collect coins to open locked blocks, and run away from chasing saws. If you complete the level quickly, you will be rewarded a medal accordingly, and these will help you get a higher score, as long as you also try not to die while dodging obstacles.
